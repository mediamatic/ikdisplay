ikDisplay

What is this?
=============

ikDisplay is an aggregator of real-time event notifications for waterfall
type displays. Event sources are configured to belong to feeds and incoming
notifications are reformatted to a common representation before republishing
to a feeds' associated XMPP publish-subscribe node. It supports various event
sources, of which many are currently tied to Mediamatic's anyMeta-based
social networking sites:

 * Subscriptions to XMPP Publish-Subscribe nodes:
   * Activity Streams events as individual Atom entries.
   * Notifications from Mediamatic's RFID-enabled interactive installations,
     including ikCam, ikPoll and the Physical "I like it" Button.
 * Real-time notifications through the Twitter Streaming API, by tracking
   keywords and/or accounts.
